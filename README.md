# Face Recognition Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates real-time face recognition using Python and the face_recognition library. It captures video from the webcam, detects faces, and compares them with known faces to recognize individuals. The known faces are stored as face encodings, and the face_recognition library is used for face detection and recognition.

## Features

- Real-time face recognition using webcam
- Comparison of detected faces with known faces
- Drawing rectangles around detected faces

## Dependencies

- Python (>= 3.6)
- OpenCV (cv2)
- face_recognition
- dlib
